            <h3> Hello there </h3> 
          </div>
          <p>You currently might be wondering why have you received this suspicious link from a suspicious guy in a suspicious alley in the city.
          Worry not you are safe. This is a collection of words and an attempt to compete with you in the dating field &#128520;. So, what inspired me to write this letter you ask?
          You. It's not something cheesy yet its not so rock-like(according to me) and I'd like this to be a successful attempt &#128151;.</p>

          <p>I was recently caught up in a dillemma. Summer's on the way, and with that my intern program. I was making a resume for that and was looking at the list of projects i've made.
            I was like "Did I do this much in last year??" and for the better part of it, i thought that it was barely acceptable in my field, but then i remembered your appriciation of those things.
            Your optimism that you had put in me and all the compliments. You were and are still there while I'm developing myself, cheering all the way but you do not see how far you've come in the regards of being a human being.
            You're employed now and are hosting Ted talks for all i know, while im still the nerd(and a lil buffed) but i still pursue being a better person.
          </p>
          <p>It's nice knowing you, your art, your music taste and your taste in women &#128128;. Your material version, your travelling spirit. Anyways I'm running out of words.. so.......</p>

          <p><strong>Thank you</strong></p>
